- Welcom to Greg's Lair.
- After the first shutdown I decided to recreate the website and eventually switched to github 
- So with a bit of background info from the past heres a real introduction
- On Greg's Lair we try to find as much unblocked games to make school more fun
- And by fun I mean probably getting into trouble after publishing this
- Anyways go off and explore Greg's Lair 
- If you have questions email, GDTdson@gmail.com
